🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a robust machine learning model to predict residential property prices based on various housing features. The objective is to leverage data-driven techniques to accurately estimate house prices, enabling better decision-making for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end ML pipeline — from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model training, evaluation, and performance optimization.

🎯 Problem Statement

Accurately predicting house prices is a critical challenge in the real estate industry due to multiple influencing factors such as location, size, number of rooms, and other property attributes.

This project aims to:

a) Analyze housing data to identify key price-driving features
b) Build predictive models using supervised learning algorithms
c) Evaluate performance using appropriate regression metrics
d) Optimize model performance through tuning and feature selection

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset includes structured housing data with features such as:

Property size (area)
Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
Location-based features
Additional property characteristics
Target variable: House Price
